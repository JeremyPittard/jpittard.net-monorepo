          <p>
            Last year I sat on a steering committee with the PFL where
            information was collected from all of the clubs in the organisation.
            The goal of this committee was to develop a consistent website for
            all of the clubs to use, that was easy for the clubs to operate or
            set and forget if they wish.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, before the committee was formed the platform the
            websites were to be built on was determined. Thatâ€™s where this
            WordPress theme comes in. The platform the clubs were put on was
            Squarespace, which has some benefits. However, there are far more
            cost-effective ways to do this where clubs still maintain all the
            benefits of Squarespace like
            <ul className="list-disc">
              <li>Drag and drop page builder</li>
              <li>Ease of use</li>
              <li>Can set and forget OR update content when they wish</li>
            </ul>
            With the added benefits of
            <ul className="list-disc">
              <li>You have control over YOUR website</li>
              <li>
                Can easily add additional features (WordPress powers more than
                40% of the web, you would have no trouble finding people to
                build features you don't have if they aren't already made as a
                plug-and-play option)
              </li>
              <li>Can also easily upgrade and make changes.</li>
              <li>
                The design has been created based on feedback from over 60 clubs
                and professional designers/developers.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </motion.main>
      </Layout>
    </>
